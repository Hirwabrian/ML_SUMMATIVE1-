Mapping the Reserve Army of Labor: A Machine Learning Analysis of Youth Labor in the U.S.
This project uses machine learning to empirically map Marx’s concept of the “reserve army of labor” by analyzing the concentration of young workers (ages 16–24) across U.S. industries. Grounded in Marxist political economy and applied data science, it bridges critical theory with modern ML techniques to reveal structural patterns of labor precarity in the post-pandemic economy.

Key Insights
Median age is the strongest predictor of youth labor share—validating age structure as a marker of class position.
Deep learning (Sequential NN) achieved R² = 0.864, outperforming traditional models.
Models struggled most in high-precarity sectors (e.g., restaurants, food services), revealing the limits of static demographics in capturing labor market volatility.
Dependencies
